        <h2 style="color:#FFFFFF; padding:10px"> This letter has given luck to the recipient, who first started in England and is now transferred to you, and must leave you within four days. You have to send seven copies including this letter to someone in need of luck. You may make a copy. You may say it's a superstition, but it's true. In England, a person named HGXWCH received this letter in 1930. He asked his secretary to make a copy and send it to him. A few days later, I won the lottery and got 2 billion won. Some received the letter but forgot to leave their hands within 96 hours. He resigned soon.
